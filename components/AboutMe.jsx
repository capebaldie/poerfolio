            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with API&#39;s and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. <br />
            Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick
            up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer
            is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for
            the job. <br />
